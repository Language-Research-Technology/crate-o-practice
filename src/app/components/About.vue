      <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg text-gray-500 md:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">General Information</h2>
      <p>Crate-O is a browser-based editor for <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate">Research Object Crates (RO-Crate)</a>. RO-Crate is a flexible, developer-friendly approach to linked-data description and packaging. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Crate-O is designed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> - describe files on a userâ€™s computer and to add contextual information about those files,</li>
        <li> - skip the files and describe abstract contextual entities such as in a Cultural Collection or an encyclopaedia, or</li>
        <li> - annotate existing resources elsewhere on the web.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Crate-O works only with <a href="https://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.com/edge">Microsoft Edge</a> at this stage as it describes files on the user&#39;s computer, and saves RO-Crate metadata there. We will be releasing versions that work with online resources directly which will be compatible with other browsers (see the <a href="https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/crate-o#roadmap--backlog">Roadmap</a>).</p>
      <br>
      <p>While the current version of Crate-O is designed for editing self-contained RO-Crates (and works fine with crates containing tens of thousands of entities), our roadmap includes editing fragments of larger linked-data resources, and integration with Arkisto repositories such as the Oni repository, data API and search portal.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Crate-O is currently developed by the <a href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/">Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA)</a>, under the guidance of Peter Sefton as technical lead. If the tool is adopted in other contexts (we are in talks with a few groups about this) then we aim to establish a steering committee/reference group to help guide development.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg text-gray-500 md:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">Crate-O Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Crate-O can be used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> - Describe data collections</li>
        <li> - Add and edit the metadata fields of a data collection</li>
        <li> - Submit a collection to the LDaCA Portal</li>
        <li> - Edit a schema</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg text-gray-500 md:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">Main Start Page Options</h2>
      <p>From the main toolbar, the following options are available:</p>
      <el-table :data="startTableData" border style="width: 100%">
        <el-table-column prop="file_option" label="File Option" width="200" />
        <el-table-column prop="description" label="Description" />
      </el-table>
      <br>
      <p><br></p>
      <h2 class="mb-3 text-lg text-gray-500 md:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">RO-Crate Collection Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>The diagram below shows the hierarchical relationship between collections, objects and files in a corpus, together with the metadata that these relationships are organised by.</p>
      <p><img src="..\assets\my_corpus.png" alt="Self-contained corpus crate with all resources"></p>
      <p>The metadata is organised by the various kinds of entities recognised in the ontology documented at schema.org at least partly based on the RDF framework.</p>
      <br>
      <el-table :data="entityTableData" border style="width: 100%">
        <el-table-column prop="entity" label="Entity" width="200" />
        <el-table-column prop="definition" label="Definition" />
      </el-table>
      <br>
      <p>For more details on these entities and their related metadata, see <a href="https://ldaca.gitbook.io/metadata-for-language-data/">Metadata for Language Data</a>.</p>
